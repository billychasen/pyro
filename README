pyro is a terminal chat client for 37signals's Campfire.

It was written in a weekend to be a home-grown alternative to the few other Campfire clients I've tried. 

There is immense room for improvement. Among the more urgent things that need to be done:
- better line editing
- chat log scrolling
- instantaneous "sending" of messages
- HTTP keep-alive

However, it's more or less usable for me, so I'll get to these things when I get to them...
